[item-description]
TN-small-atomic-artillery-shell=500t yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 40m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 300m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 500m radius. Use with caution.

TN-atomic-artillery-shell=1kt yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 80m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 500m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 1km radius. Use with extreme caution.

TN-big-atomic-artillery-shell=15kt yield, roughly equivalent to the Little Boy. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 200m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 1000m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 3km radius. This weapon is so devastating, it may crash the game, it has no practical use, and is merely here for demonstrative purposes. Use with extreme caution, or a death wish.

TN-very-big-atomic-artillery-shell=100kt yield, roughly equivalent to the W-76. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 500m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 3000m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 5.5km radius. The 15kt weapon is enough to make the game think pretty hard, this one involves at least a few minutes of loading first. Likely to crash the game. There is no level of caution which will make this weapon safe. For those who wish to watch the world burn, in slideshow form.

atomic-bomb=20t yield, roughly equivalent to the Davy Crockett. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 20m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for 150m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 300m radius. Use with caution.

big-atomic-bomb=500t yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 40m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 300m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 500m radius. This weapon is very slow moving, so takes a while to reach its target. Bring a get-away vehicle, use with extreme caution.

very-big-atomic-bomb=1kt yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 80m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 500m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 1km radius. This weapon is very slow moving, so takes a while to reach its target. Bring a very fast get-away vehicle, while wearing power armor. Use with extreme caution.

atomic-autocannon-shell=0.5t yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 2m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for 30m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 50m radius. Can be fired from the light-tank with minimal damage, although a nearby hit can instantly vaporize both the tank, and the player.

atomic-cannon-shell=2t yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 5m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for 50m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 100m radius. Can be fired from the tank with minimal damage, although a nearby hit can instantly vaporize both the tank, and the player.

atomic-cannon-H1-shell=4t yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 7m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for 80m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 150m radius. Can be fired from the heavy-tank with minimal damage, although a nearby hit can instantly vaporize both the tank, and the player.

atomic-cannon-H2-shell=8t yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 15m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for 120m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 200m radius. Can be fired from the super-heavy-tank with minimal damage, although a nearby hit can instantly vaporize both the tank, and the player.

big-atomic-autocannon-shell=2t yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 5m.

Can be fired from the super-heavy-tank with minimal damage, although a nearby hit can instantly vaporize both the tank, and the player.

atomic-rounds-magazine=0.1t yield. When using this ammunition the gun will not auto-target enemies, so needs pointing manually. The fire-rate is lower than that of normal ammunition, but still very high. Thanks to the short range of the gun, damage is inevitable, so power armor is recommended. Use with caution.

Thanks to the short range of the gun, damage is inevitable, so power armor is recommended. Use with extreme caution.

californium=This element is highly radioactive. It has a critical mass of only 5kg, and this can be lowered further using neutron reflectors. These properties make it a great way of producing small nuclear weapons, while still acheiveing a detonation.

fire-shield-equipment=This device provides minimal shielding, but can prevent the thing it is attached to from being set on fire by nuclear weapons or thermobaric devices, although it uses a lot of power to do so. (This does not prevent any other form of fire damage, or being set on fire by other means)

thermobaric-autocannon-shell=A fuel heavy tank shell, causes a 15m radius wave of fire, causing significant impact and fire damage, as well as lighting fires. Can be fired from the light-tank taking minimal damage, and even a near hit will only do some damage. 

thermobaric-cannon-shell=A fuel heavy tank shell, causes a 30m radius wave of fire, causing significant impact and fire damage, as well as lighting fires. Can be fired from the tank taking minimal damage, and even a near hit will only do some damage. 

thermobaric-cannon-H1-shell=A fuel heavy tank shell, causes a 45m radius wave of fire, causing significant impact and fire damage, as well as lighting fires. Can be fired from the tank taking minimal damage, and even a near hit will only do some damage. 

thermobaric-cannon-H2-shell=A fuel heavy tank shell, causes a 60m radius wave of fire, causing significant impact and fire damage, as well as lighting fires. Can be fired from the tank taking minimal damage, and even a near hit will only do some damage. 

thermobaric-rocket=A fuel heavy rocket, causes a 80m radius wave of fire, causing significant impact and fire damage, as well as lighting fires. Can be fired wearing heavy armour, and survived, although a lot of damage will be taken. 

thermobaric-artillery-shell=A fuel heavy artillery shell, causes a 120m radius wave of fire, causing significant impact and fire damage, as well as lighting fires. 

[technology-name]
scary-atomic-weapons=Very dangerous high-yield atomic weapons
atomic-artillery-shells=Atomic artillery shells
thermobaric-weaponry=Thermobaric weaponry
californium-processing=Californium processing

[technology-description]
scary-atomic-weapons=Bigger nuclear weapons, and worse ways of deploying them. These nuclear weapons are devastating. From the 100kt shell, capable of flattening an entire factory (or crashing the game), to the smaller weapons, which are only dangerous due to their method of deployment, but this still makes for an easy death. 
atomic-artillery-shells=With the larger space in an artillery shell, these weapons have much higher yields, capable of destroying huge areas at once, and their long range helps the firing position survive.
atomic-bomb=These devastating weapons have relatively low yields, but can still destroy almost anything.
californium-processing=The low critical mass of Californium allows incredibly small nuclear weapons, allowing them to be used in many more situations. 
thermobaric-weaponry=These weapons use a high level of fuel relative to their oxidizer, resulting in a large blast wave, as the fuel reacts with the air. They don't do much damage, but do it over a wide area. They are not much good against single strong targets, but are great at killing swarms of weaker enemies. They also light lots of fires, so create lots of pollution.

[mod-setting-name]
crater-water-filling=Enable craters filling with water
nuke-random-fires=Enable nuclear weapons causing large numbers of short lived fires
large-nuke-fire-scaledown=Large nuclear weapon fire reduction
huge-nuke-fire-scaledown=Hiroshima scale weapon fire reduction
really-huge-nuke-fire-scaledown=100kt weapon fire reduction
large-nuke-blast-range-scaledown=Large nuclear weapon blast range reduction
enable-thermobaric=Enable thermobaric weapons
use-californium=Enable californium

[mod-setting-description]
crater-water-filling=With this setting enabled, the nuclear craters slowly fill with water, this can cause trouble when drones are trying to replace buildings above the crater. After the crater has finished building it will ghost landfill above itself, but up to this point, any landfill placed is repeatedly destroyed.
nuke-random-fires=With this setting enabled, nuclear weapons create lots of small, short lived fires, which can cause lag issues, but create a nice scorched effect.
large-nuke-fire-scaledown=Since the artillery nukes are so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires)
huge-nuke-fire-scaledown=Since the larger nukes are so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, and few living creatures survive close enough to see the crater anyway, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires)
really-huge-nuke-fire-scaledown=Since the 100kt nuke is so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, and few living creatures survive close enough to see the crater anyway, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires) This is very important for the 100kt, and can prevent the game crashing from running out of memory.
large-nuke-blast-range-scaledown=Since the larger nukes are so huge, this setting reduces simulated range of the blast. This can significantly improve performance, as the further out the wave goes, the more entities are hit. This does not increase the amount of world loaded, so a hard cutoff will still be present in unexplored areas. The default will usually stop at about the point where the blast is not longer destroying many buildings, only damaging them. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the blast radius)
enable-thermobaric=This mod is primarily about nuclear weapons, but with the ability to simulate blast waves, thermobaric weapons were not hard to add, however, as they are available earlier in the game, they may be much more balance-breaking. They are also a much less accurate rendering, merely desinged to look cool, as little data is readily available on the various effects of thermobaric weapons.
use-californium=Unsetting this will change all recipies using californium to use U-235 instead. This makes it less realistic, but removes the extra production step, and makes the smaller weapons cheaper.
