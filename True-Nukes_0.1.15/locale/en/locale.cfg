15kiloton-detonation=15kt yield, roughly equivalent to the Little Boy. Detonating the weapon in this mode does not use the fusion stage, and is a simple fission weapon. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 200m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 1000m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 3km radius. This weapons can be used safely... Just.

100kiloton-detonation=100kt yield, roughly equivalent to the W-76. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 500m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 2000m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 5.5km radius. This weapon is so devastating, it may crash the game, and has little practical use, being here for demonstrative purposes. Use with extreme caution, or a death wish. 

megaton-detonation=1Mt yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 1200m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 5000m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 12km radius. This weapon is so devastating, it will crash the game if your computer has less than 20Gb of RAM, and will wipe out basically everything on the map. The game will freeze for several minutes, and your OS may alert you to non-responsiveness. There is no level of caution which will make this weapon safe. For those who wish to watch the world burn, in slideshow form.

megaton-nuke=The scale and complexity of a fusion device means that a building is needed to house the weapon and detonator. This weapon gives you 2 minutes to escape before detonating.

Bring a get-away vehicle, use with extreme caution.

very-big-atomic-bomb=1kt yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 80m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 500m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 1km radius. This weapon is very slow moving, so takes a while to reach its target. Bring a very fast get-away vehicle, while wearing power armor. Use with extreme caution.

Can be fired from the super-heavy-tank with minimal damage, although a nearby hit can instantly vaporize both the tank, and the player.

atomic-rounds-magazine=0.1t yield. When using this ammunition the gun will not auto-target enemies, so needs pointing manually. The fire-rate is lower than that of normal ammunition, but still very high. Thanks to the short range of the gun, damage is inevitable, so power armor is recommended. Use with caution.

Thanks to the short range of the gun, damage is inevitable, so power armor is recommended. Use with extreme caution.

californium=This element is highly radioactive. It has a critical mass of only 5kg, and this can be lowered further using neutron reflectors. These properties make it a great way of producing small nuclear weapons, while still achieving a detonation.

californium-processing=Californium processing

[technology-description]
fusion-weapons=For those times when just killing everything on [font=default-bold]half[/font] the map isn't enough - you want to wipe out everything... possibly including the game.
tritium-proccessing=A radioactive isotope of hydrogen, only obtainable through the high radiation enviroment inside a nuclear reactor. Useful for backlights on watches, illumating crosshairs on scopes, and making fusion weapons. 
scary-atomic-weapons=Bigger nuclear weapons, and worse ways of deploying them. These nuclear weapons are devastating. From the 15kt shell, capable of flattening an entire factory (or crashing the game), to the smaller weapons, which are only dangerous due to their method of deployment, but this still makes for an easy death. 
atomic-artillery-shells=With the larger space in an artillery shell, these weapons have much higher yields, capable of destroying huge areas at once, and their long range helps the firing position survive.
atomic-bomb=These devastating weapons have relatively low yields, but can still destroy almost anything.
californium-processing=The low critical mass of Californium allows incredibly small nuclear weapons, allowing them to be used in many more situations. 
thermobaric-weaponry=These weapons use a high level of fuel relative to their oxidizer, resulting in a large blast wave, as the fuel reacts with the air. They don't do much damage, but do it over a wide area. They are not much good against single strong targets, but are great at killing swarms of weaker enemies. They also light lots of fires, so create lots of pollution.

keep-atomic-research-without-weapons=Retain atomic research without unlocks 
keep-atomic-bomb-without-changes=Retain unlock for vanilla atomic bomb

[mod-setting-description]
keep-atomic-research-without-weapons=For compatability, in case you disable all the nukes, including the base-game one, and another mod still needs access to the atomic-bomb research.

keep-atomic-bomb-without-changes=For compatability, so you can unlock the vannila nuke, without and changes having been made to it.

destroy-resources-in-crater=This setting can be used to make sure that resources aren't destroyed by nuclear weapons at all. No guarentees are made about this looking natural with tile transitions

nuke-crater-noise=With this setting enabled some noise is produced at the edge of the larger craters to make them seem more natural.

crater-water-filling=With this setting enabled, the nuclear craters slowly fill with water, this can cause trouble when drones are trying to replace buildings above the crater. After the crater has finished building it will ghost landfill above itself, but up to this point, any landfill placed is repeatedly destroyed.

nuke-random-fires=With this setting enabled, nuclear weapons create lots of small, short lived fires, which can cause lag issues, but create a nice scorched effect.

large-nuke-fire-scaledown=Since the artillery nukes are so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires)

huge-nuke-fire-scaledown=Since the larger nukes are so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, and few living creatures survive close enough to see the crater anyway, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires)

really-huge-nuke-fire-scaledown=Since the 100kt nuke is so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, and few living creatures survive close enough to see the crater anyway, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires) This is very important for the 100kt, and can prevent the game crashing from running out of memory.

mega-nuke-fire-scaledown=Since the 1Mt nuke is so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, and few living creatures survive close enough to see the crater anyway, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires) This is very important for the 1Mt, and can prevent the game crashing from running out of memory.

large-nuke-blast-range-scaledown=Since the 15kt nukes are so huge, this setting reduces simulated range of the blast. This can significantly improve performance, as the further out the wave goes, the more entities are hit. This does not increase the amount of world loaded, so a hard cutoff will still be present in unexplored areas. The default will usually stop at about the point where the blast is not longer destroying many buildings, only damaging them. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the blast radius)

really-huge-nuke-blast-range-scaledown=Since the 100kt nukes are so huge, this setting reduces simulated range of the blast. This can significantly improve performance, as the further out the wave goes, the more entities are hit. This does not increase the amount of world loaded, so a hard cutoff will still be present in unexplored areas. The default will usually stop at about the point where the blast is not longer destroying many buildings, only damaging them. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the blast radius)

mega-nuke-blast-range-scaledown=Since the 1Mt nukes are so huge, this setting reduces simulated range of the blast. This can significantly improve performance, as the further out the wave goes, the more entities are hit. This does not increase the amount of world loaded, so a hard cutoff will still be present in unexplored areas. The default will usually stop at about the point where the blast is not longer destroying many buildings, only damaging them. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the blast radius)

enable-thermobaric=This mod is primarily about nuclear weapons, but with the ability to simulate blast waves, thermobaric weapons were not hard to add, however, as they are available earlier in the game, they may be much more balance-breaking. They are also a much less accurate rendering, merely desinged to look cool, as little data is readily available on the various effects of thermobaric weapons.

use-californium=Unsetting this will change all recipies using californium to use U-235 instead. This makes it less realistic, but removes the extra production step, and makes the smaller weapons cheaper.


TN-mushroom-cloud-style-nuclear-flash=If enabled, nuclear explosions will cause a bright flash in their vincinity.\n\nEPILEPSY WARNING:\nSome persons may experience epileptic seizures if they are exposed to certain light frequencies, flickering lights or geometric forms/patterns. In this case I strongly recommend to disable this option! 

enable-new-craters=Enables the new crater tiles - disabling this option will break any pre-existing crater tiles in your map, so fill them in or dig them up first - primarily here for mod compatibility, although if this is required, feel free to submit a bug report on the mod's page, as I might be able to fix it.

use-height-for-craters=Enables the height aware crater system - disabling this will not break anything, but will mean any new nukes fired use the old system (no heights or water motion). This may improve performance significantly, particularly if the lag is happening for a long time after the detonation as the craters fill with water.

use-efficient-thermal=This is a more aggressively optimised way of doing the initial blast for the nukes. It may improve performance, and reduce memory usage, but may also break other mods and not be as nice-looking.
