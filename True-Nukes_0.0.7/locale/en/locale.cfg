[item-description]
big-atomic-artillery-shell=15kt yield, roughly equivalent to the Little Boy. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 200m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 1000m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 3km radius. This weapon is so devastating, it may crash the game, it has no practical use, and is merely here for demonstrative purposes.
atomic-artillery-shell=1kt yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 80m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 500m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 1km radius. Use with extreme caution.
small-atomic-artillery-shell=500t yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 40m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for over 300m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 500m radius. Use with caution.
atomic-bomb=20t yield, roughly equivalent to the Davy Crockett. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 20m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for 150m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across a 300m radius. Use with caution.
atomic-cannon-shell=2t yield. When detonated, a fireball is formed, vaporizing anything within 2m. This creates an energy wave, causing fires for 50m, and a blast wave, causing sweeping destruction across over 100m radius. Can be fired from the tank with minimal damage, although a nearby hit can instantly vaporize both the tank, and the player.
thermobaric-cannon-shell=A fuel heavy tank shell, causes a 40m radius wave of fire, causing significant impact and fire damage, as well as lighting fires. Can be fired from the tank taking minimal damage, and even a near hit will only do some damage. 
thermobaric-rocket=A fuel heavy rocket, causes a 80m radius wave of fire, causing significant impact and fire damage, as well as lighting fires. Can be fired wearing heavy armour, and survived, although a lot of damage will be taken. 
thermobaric-artillery-shell=A fuel heavy artillery shell, causes a 120m radius wave of fire, causing significant impact and fire damage, as well as lighting fires. 

[technology-name]
atomic-artillery-shells=Atomic artillery shells
thermobaric-weaponry=Thermobaric weaponry

[technology-description]
atomic-artillery-shells=With the larger space in an artillery shell, these weapons have much higher yields, capable of destroying huge areas at once, and their long range helps the firing position survive.
atomic-bomb=These devastating weapons have relatively low yields, but can still destroy almost anything.
thermobaric-weaponry=These weapons use a high level of fuel relative to their oxidizer, resulting in a large blast wave, as teh fuel reacts with the air. They don't do much damage, but do it over a wide area. They are not much good against single strong targets, but are great at killing swarms of weaker enemies. They also light lots of fires, so create lots of pollution.

[mod-setting-name]
crater-water-filling=Enable craters filling with water
nuke-random-fires=Enable nuclear weapons causing large numbers of short lived fires
hiroshima-fire-scaledown=Hiroshima scale fire scaledown
hiroshima-blast-range-scaledown=Hiroshima blast range scaledown
enable-thermobaric=Enable thermobaric weapons

[mod-setting-description]
crater-water-filling=With this setting enabled, the nuclear craters slowly fill with water, this can cause trouble when drones are trying to replace buildings above the crater. After the crater has finished building it will ghost landfill above itself, but up to this point, any landfill placed is repeatedly destroyed.
nuke-random-fires=With this setting enabled, nuclear weapons create lots of small, short lived fires, which can cause lag issues, but create a nice scorched effect.
hiroshima-fire-scaledown=Since the hiroshima nuke is so huge, this setting reduces the number of fires created in the crater. This can significantly improve performance, and few living creatures survive close enough to see the crater anyway, however the bare crater does not look as devastated. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the number of fires)
hiroshima-blast-range-scaledown=Since the hiroshima nuke is so huge, this setting reduces simulated range of the blast. This can significantly improve performance, as the further out the wave goes, the more entities are hit. This does not increase the amount of world loaded, so a hard cutoff will still be present in unexplored areas. The default will usually stop at about the point where the blast is not longer destroying many buildings, only damaging them. (A value of 2 here results in a halving of the blast radius)
enable-thermobaric=This mod is primarily about nuclear weapons, but with the ability to simulate blast waves, thermobaric weapons were not hard to add, however, as they are available earlier in the game, they may be much more balance-breaking. They are also a much less accurate rendering, merely desinged to look cool, as little data is readily available on the various effects of thermobaric weapons.
