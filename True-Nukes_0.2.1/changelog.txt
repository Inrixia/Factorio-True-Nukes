---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2021-09-26
  Optimisations:
    - Reduced redundant API calls in water flow code - about 2x faster now
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed edge-of-crater problem for larger nukes in water
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2021-09-24
  Optimisations:
    - Added chunk-based damage loading, so the bigger nukes (>=100kt) don't load any map, instead apply damage to map as it is generated. This reduces memory usage to near-zero, and is only slow for big factories. Inspired by the changes made by RealisticFusionWeaponry.
  Features:
    - Even bigger nukes: 5Mt, 10Mt, 50Mt, 100Mt and 1Gt (and to be honest, the potential for unlimited yield - these are only the ones I have implemented).
    - Added remote call interface for useful functions
    - Instead of removing decoratives in the fireball, it now replaces them with more dead looking ones
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.17
Date: 2021-08-18
  Bugfixes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.16
Date: 2021-08-15

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.15
Date: 2021-08-12

  Bugfixes:
    - Added migration scripts for new weapons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.14
Date: 2021-07-28
  Features:
    - Some excellent new sprites for the artillery shells by wretlaw120 (https://mods.factorio.com/user/wretlaw120) who actually contributed all these changes! Thanks!
    - A small rearangement moving 4t and 8t rockets behind Very dangerous high-yield atomic weapons
  Bugfixes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.13
Date: 2021-07-22
  Features:
    - Increased range on small rocket-nukes
    - Changed icons for 20t, 500t and 1kt artillery nukes
    - The mod now changes the rocket to grey if there any small atomic-rockets (2t, 4t, 8t) enabled - to avoid confusion  
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed wrong ranges on cannon shells
    - Fixed ordering issues on 20t atomic artillery shell
  Optimisations:
    - Fixed massive inefficiencies for crater system - not as likely to crash for really big nukes (1Mt, 100kt)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.12
Date: 2021-07-20
  Features:
    - Added glow effects to all nukes and nuke-related items (e.g. Californium, Tritium)
    - Changes to graphics for small atomic artillery shell
    - Added new smaller atomic artillery shell (20t)
    - Added new smaller atomic rockets (2t, 4t, 8t) - sorry that the 2t looks like the basic rocket, I couldn't think of anything else
    - Added option for a more aggressively optimised detonation system, but this might not actually save all that much, so is off by default (in Settings->Mod settings->Map Settings->Use more optimised detonation system (BETA))
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed wrong pictures for items on ground
    - Increased range of cannon shells to full intended range
    - Decreased stack size of High yield atomic cannon shells to intended levels
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.9
Date: 2021-07-14

    - Added pollution output to Nukes
    - Updated technology icons

    - Fixed Changelog (again)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.8
Date: 2021-04-25

    - Added setting to preserve resources in craters - this might not be too pretty depending on how the tile transitions happen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.7
Date: 2021-04-06
  Features:
    - Added new crater system (and option to go back to old system, which may be signifacntly higher performance, old system enhanced by mandelbrodt on github - thanks)
    - Added crater filling with more dynamic water, so that it flows in from lakes etc.
    - Also made the nukes vapourise any water inside their fireball
    - Added new tiles to allow new crater system - this may break other mods, so there is an option to remove these, but this will make maps with them in not load properly
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed use-tritium setting, as this was never implemented (and, presumably, never used, as I never got a bug report!!!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.6
Date: 2021-02-24
  Features:
    - Added Megaton nukes

    - Increased the jump radius of the blast wave, to compensate for the slower proccessing rate
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
